### About me

I have been making contributions to Istio for the last 1.5 years in terms of code, code reviews, design discussions, conferenece presentations and blogging. Though my tenure has been short, I was able to make contributions to the project across multiple areas including networking, security, documentation, integration tests, and marketing, and is currently a Documentation and Test and Release Maintainer for Istio. I have served in the Istio Steering Committee in the last term, and have co-chaired the first `Istio Day` co-located with KubeCon Europe, which was very well received by the audience. I am also proud of having supported our [CNCF graduation journey](https://istio.io/blog/2023/istio-graduates-within-cncf/), being a Steering Committee member. I am excited to be chairing the upcoming `Istio Day` co-located with KubeCon North America as well.

I have been a speaker at various previous KubeCon, IstioCon and other events, and have also conducted several sessions speaking about ServiceMesh and Istio in specific. I am a key member of the Telco 5G Transformation Team in my organization, and my focus is on successfully including Istio in our 5G journey!

### Why I'm running

I would like to continue representing the voice of Telco users in the Istio Community by running in this election. Though Istio has a great team leading from the forefront, I believe 5G Transofrmation is one of the major areas where Istio could play a key role, and it is quite important to represent and steer this journey at an organizational level, including the recent Ambient Mesh advancements. I have been an opensource evangelist trying to make opensource reach more and more people through University presentations, conferences, free workshops, and student mentoring. I have also served as a LinuxFoundation mentor for University Students. By being in the Steering committee, my goal would be to bring more traction for Istio among new comers, students, and of course 5G Telco users, by making our message to market more visible. I have been actively supporting the "Women in Istio" community by offering all technical/non-technical support, and would love to continue doing that.
